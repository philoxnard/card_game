"""A list of issues


Other things that should be tweaked/fixed/changed:
    
    Need to actually end the game
    
    Display whose turn it is
    
    When in the attacking state, i'd like to change the cursor to a sword
    or something like that
    
    When in the attacking state, i'd like to have some visual to show which 
    card is attacking
    
    When a card has summoning sickness, I'd like a visual indicator, maybe
    a Zzz or something similar
    
    Draw a card's devotion cost and energy cost straight onto the card
    maybe the energy can stay as boxes, i like them
    
    Also maybe draw the card name on the card? Possibly art too? Text???
    
    Also can draw life total, devotion total, and energy total as ints
    instead of as colored boxes - but tbh I kinda like the boxes
    
    SO much cleaning up to do - finding a way to make active_player a 
    class attribute would be huuuuugely helpful in cleaning stuff up
