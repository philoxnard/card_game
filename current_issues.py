"""A list of issues or necessary changes

    Make a spell effect for dealing X damage to a character
        Also a spell effect for dealing X to any target
        
    Eventually make a new library for Spell effects

    Gotta write a README to explain the purpose and function
        Also gotta do an overhaul on documentation
    
    Gotta eventually network this bad boy and allow the player to make
        their own deck
        
    Balance of course! And need to update with taxes and identities/kingdoms
        Really I need an entirely new understanding of what the cards are going
        to be.

    Make some preconstructed decks and a main menu that allows players to pick
        their decks
        
    There are a lot of things that are told to the player via text in the 
        console - they must be changed to be made visible somehow - 
        possibly even add sound??
    
Other things that should be tweaked/fixed/changed:

    Find a more concise way to draw all of the icons on cards
    Literally everything that gets drawn to cards is SO messy in terms of how
        its done. Gotta fix it.
    
    Show how many cards enemy has in hand
    
    Need to actually end the game
        For now, just need to display a congrats message for winning player,
        or something like Player 1 wins!
    
    Display whose turn it is, make it clear which battlefield is which
    
    Indicate if you have devoted yet this turn
        draw something if player.devotion_limit is or isnt 0
